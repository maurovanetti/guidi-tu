Select the SOBER DRIVER with this digital eeny-meeny-miny-moe.

Who drinks alcohol doesn't drive, TOO DANGEROUS.
Every group should have a SOBER DRIVER.
By playing one of this app's mini games, you decide WHO DRINKS and WHO DRIVES.

Whoever comes last, drives and doesn't drink. But watch out: whoever comes first, can drink but must pay. Therefore, it's better to get to mid-table!
Possible penalties for who comes first:
* Pay for non-alcoholic drinks for the Sober Driver?
* Offer snacks to everyone?
* Pay the fuel?
